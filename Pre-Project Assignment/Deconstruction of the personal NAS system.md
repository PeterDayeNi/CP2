# Deconstruction of the personal NAS system
## Overall 

NAS is referring to Network Attached Storage. With the development of the science and technology, the digital files are becoming lager and lager. However, at the same time, with the limitation of the hardware, the storage space doesn’t grow as fast as the file size, so NAS born. Although NAS bring some convenience, there are still lots of problems. For example, personal privacy, file safety problem and price of the rental. You are renting other’s storage space, which you don’t have full control of the hardware, so they may access your files or even worse — delete it. And the price may unfriendly for personal user or small business.   

So people start to build personal NAS. There is ready-made NAS by different technology company, but I think it is too expensive for personal use or small business. And there is a solution base on Raspberry Pi to build a personal NAS.


## Software Part

For the software part, it’s very simple, and there are many way you can do it. The easiest way is to install Syncloud system on your Raspberry Pi. However, your Raspberry can only be used as a personal NAS. The other way is to install Raspbian system, then install the software like ArOZ Online or Nextcloud. 

## Hardware Part

For hardware part, all you need to do is a hard disk connect to the Raspberry Pi and find a disk holder. Shoe box will be a nice choice if you can’t find a suitable disk holder.
