# Deconstruction of the personal NAS system
## Overall 

NAS is referring to Network Attached Storage. With the development of the science and technology, the digital files are becoming lager and lager. However, at the same time, with the limitation of the hardware, the storage space doesn’t grow as fast as the file size, so NAS born. Although NAS bring some convenience, there are still lots of problems. For example, personal privacy, file safety problem and price of the rental. You are renting other’s storage space, which you don’t have full control of the hardware, so they may access your files or even worse — delete it. And the price may unfriendly for personal user or small business.   

So people start to build personal NAS. There is ready-made NAS by different technology company, but I think it is too expensive for personal use or small business. And there is a solution base on Raspberry Pi to build a personal NAS.


## Software Part

For the software part, it’s like a bridge or gate, and there are many way you can do it. 
The software like ArOZ Online or Nextcloud on Raspbian system is designed to do this job. So basicly this kind of software create a platform that you can connect to by your computer, and when you put the files you want to storage in hard drive on this platform. Then the platform will sort out the files and put it in to the hard drive. Also, you can access the platform on any device by using your own account. 

## Hardware Part

For hardware part, is the place where you put your files in. Usually it is a hard disk holder with a power supply, and with hard drives in it. It is the same as the bookcase which you place your books.
