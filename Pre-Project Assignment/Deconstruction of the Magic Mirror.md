# Deconstruction of the Magic Mirror 
## Overall

Magic Mirror is also an interesting project that I found when I searching about Raspberry Pi. Magic Mirror is original from the science fiction, and it is a part of positive vision of the future. Magic Mirror can be put together easily base on Raspberry Pi. I think that the Magic Mirror can be integrated in the personal NAS system, but it is a more separate project. If Raspberry Pi is a tree, then Magic Mirror and NAS system are two of the brunch of it. 

Magic Mirror is basically a mirror with information on it, including time, date, weather and so on.
