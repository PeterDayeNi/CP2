# Deconstruction of the Magic Mirror 
## Overall

Magic Mirror is also an interesting project that I found when I searching about Raspberry Pi. Magic Mirror is original from the science fiction, and it is a part of positive vision of the future. Magic Mirror can be put together easily base on Raspberry Pi. I think that the Magic Mirror can be integrated in the personal NAS system, but it is a more separate project. If Raspberry Pi is a tree, then Magic Mirror and NAS system are two of the brunch of it. 

Magic Mirror is basically a mirror with information on it, including time, date, weather and so on. 

## Software

There are lots of open source software on the Raspberry Pi system. They all play a role of personal assistent. They collect the information you need from internet including the time and weather. Then after organizing all the data, this "assistent" put the information in the layout that you designed on the monitor. 

## Hardware

The magic mirror is base on a monitor and a one-way mirror. The one-way mirror can let the light of the monitor go through so the information can "show" on the mirror, and it doesn't change the original job of mirror.
