# Final Project
## idea 1
For the first idea, I want to build a magic mirror on the monitor that next to my bed. So every morning when I wake up, I can know the time and weather at once. Also, I want to connect to the Google Assistance and something else. In this way, I can have a personal magic mirror assistance.  

## idea 2
The idea 2 is part of my photography class final project. So in my photo project, I have 21 photos of unclear faces. I used YOLO to detect faces. So when the audience walk pass the camera, a real time photo will show up on the monitor, and audience's face will become the 22nd face of the show.
